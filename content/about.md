This blog is about things I've learned to do, things I haven't exactly learned
but have nonetheless managed to do, and occasionally things I'm just confounded
by. The contents are going to be in large part about techniques or tools I've
been grappling / farting about with in my daily work, with the occasional
tutorial or deep dive
on a topic I know a bit more about.

I've been exceedingly fortunate to learn from some great teachers and some
dedicated bloggers. This blog is my modest contribution in kind.

# get in touch

This blog doesn't have comments. I'm interested in hearing from people but I'm
not interested in all the busywork that goes with incorporating and managing
a comments facility. But I'm really keen to hear from you if anything here's
been helpful or less than helpful. Don't be a stranger!

# about me

I write and maintain firmware. I live in Britain and I work (mostly) on embedded
firmware. I'm super-into music and musical instruments, and I spend most of my
free time learning, quite slowly, how to make them.

During my PhD, I developed a new approach for generating Go components directly
from verified CSP formal models of concurrent protocols, and my Masters focused
on the implementation of command protocol firmware for high-speed multimedia
networks on low-resourced XMOS microcontrollers.
